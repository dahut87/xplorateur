[level1/6-name]=Activation
[level1/6-desc]=The goal is to generate 6 neutrals electrons. It's necessary to learn how to use the fiber on which the photon are moving on. Some transmuters need to be activated to be usable since 10 cycles.

[level2/1-desc]=Deuterium (symbol D or 2H, also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen. The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common hydrogen isotope, protium, has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in 6420 of hydrogen.
